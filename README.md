# posture-recognition-and-correction
Real-time detection of sitting posture not only helps prevent myopia and such in time but also promotes the improvement of efficiency while using the system.
This project proceeds to capture live video frames using a standard Web camera, without the needfor any external devices or sensors.
It is then processed frame by frame using Mediapipe, a framework of computer vision and deep learning that uses Blazepose topology to estimate the posture.
